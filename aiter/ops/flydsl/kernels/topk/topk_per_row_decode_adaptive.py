"""FlyDSL decode TopK-per-row kernel, with a per-row candidate buffer

Computes an unordered Top-K index set per decode row from one persistent launch,
grid=(blocks_per_row, num_rows), picking a per-row strategy by valid length --
which is what a decode batch needs, since its sequences differ in length. Each row
derives how many of its blocks_per_row workgroups cooperate (active_parts); the
rest return immediately. The candidate buffer is what distinguishes this kernel
from the ancestor `topk_per_row_decode_tiered`: a pass writes the elements that
survive the settled digit, and the passes behind it read those instead of the row.

Inputs/outputs:
  - logits: fp32, logical shape (num_rows, L), strides (stride0, stride1) with
    stride1 == 1 (contiguous within a row).
  - seq_lens: int32 causal lengths per sequence; row r scores sequence r // next_n at
    decode slot r % next_n, valid length seq_len - next_n + slot + 1.
  - indices: flattened int32 output with shape (num_rows, top_k); each row writes its
    unordered Top-K index set. A row with fewer than top_k valid entries is
    identity-filled and padded with -1.
  - workspace: row-major int32 scratch sized by topk_workspace_slots(num_rows,
    bits_per_pass). The multi-block tiers merge per-block LDS histograms into its
    pass-private global histograms over an inter-workgroup acquire/release barrier and
    coordinate through its counters; the single-workgroup tier never touches it.

Paths (per row, by valid length row_len):
  - short (row_len <= short_max): active_parts = 1; part 0 runs the whole radix-select
    in one workgroup — LDS-only histograms, no inter-workgroup barrier, no workspace
    round-trip.
  - mid (short_max < row_len <= mid_max): active_parts = min(blocks_per_row, mid_cap).
  - long (row_len > mid_max): active_parts = min(blocks_per_row, long_cap).

Constraints:
  - logits are fp32; the order-preserving radix key twiddle is fp32-specific.
  - bits_per_pass is 10 or 11; the short tier requires 11 bits (2048-bin LDS histogram).
  - BLOCK_THREADS is fixed at 1024 (wave64); the histogram/scan layout and the
    occupancy deadlock guard rely on it.
  - workspace must be zeroed before any launch that enters a multi-block tier; its
    counters and histograms accumulate from zero (needs_workspace_zero reports when).
  - The row barrier spins (s_sleep), so a row's blocks_per_row workgroups must be
    co-resident. This is a regular launch, not hipLaunchCooperativeKernel, and is safe
    only because the grid is flattened x-fastest: a row's parts launch contiguously
    and drain in order, which is scheduler launch order rather than a cooperative
    guarantee. Do not reorder the grid. The deadlock guard keeps
    num_rows * blocks_per_row co-resident, forcing larger batches onto the
    barrier-free short tier.
